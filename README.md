## üîê API Key Setup

This project uses the **Spotify Public API** from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/Glavier/api/spotify23/).

To run the project successfully:

1. Go to [Spotify23 API on RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/Glavier/api/spotify23/)
2. Subscribe to the API and get your **API key**
3. Replace the placeholder `API_KEY_HERE` in the code with your actual key.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è For security, the actual API key is not included in the code. You need to add yours manually.
